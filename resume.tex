        \begin{rSubsection}{Kindred group}{02/2013 -- present}{PHP Programmer}{}

            \item I~implemented a~distributed data collection service using the~AWS~infrastructure.
            The~servers are written in Literate~CoffeeScript and~the~data is stored in a~NoSQL database.

            \item I~analyzed, designed and~developed the~back~end of web~applications.
            They were mostly based on the~Nette~framework with MySQL,
            but I~also developed an~e-shop in~Magneto and~collaborated on projects in Symfony~2 with the~Kunstmaan~CMS.

            \item I~regularly directly communicated with clients on projects specifics during the~analysis phases.

            \item I~designed and~executed the~migration process and~cleanup of over 2000 emails to a~new email marketing provider.

            \item While coding HTML newsletter emails, I~created a~“meta language” in~PHP based on the~HTML object~model.
            This~allowed me to effortlessly create content and~locale variations of the~emails.
            That, paired with the~dotMailer~API client library I~wrote, cut the~estimated email deployment times by~80\%.
            The~library was later recognized by~dotMailer and~added to their list of community~projects.
        \end{rSubsection}

        \begin{rSubsection}{Accenture Services}{03/2011 -- 01/2013}{Application Operation Specialist}{}
            \item I~was responsible for~running and~maintaining an~e-Billing application spread over multiple~servers.
            The~application core was an~Oracle database running on~an~HP-UX~machine.
            Data (PDF, XML) preprocessing and~loading was~controlled by~about four~hundred shell scripts and~binaries.
            Final data population was~provided by 16~MS~Win~2005 servers with~ASP.
            My~duties included: shell~script editing and~development, log~analysis (UNIX, DB),
            installation of~patches and~releases (UNIX, WIN), performance tuning (UNIX)
            and~administration of 9~MS~Win~2005 servers with~ASP.

            \item I~also volunteered and~created a~web application providing incident tracking for~our~project.
            This~application was~based on~PHP~5.3 with the~Nette framework, MySQL and~jQuery.
